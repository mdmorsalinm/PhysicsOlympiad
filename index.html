        <h2>WHAT WE DO?</h2>
        <pre>
          Through studying sessions and engaging discussions, we aim to 
          foster a deeper understanding of physics. Our main focus is 
          preparing for national-level physics competitions, where we 
          put our knowledge and skills to the test against other students 
          from across the country. We are planning on competing in the well
          renowned F=ma competition, Physics Bowl and even USAPHO! We're 
          also hoping to plan fun events like field trips to local science 
          institutions, so be on the lookout
