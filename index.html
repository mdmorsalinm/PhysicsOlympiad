          <h2>WHAT WE DO?</h2>
          <pre>
            Through studying sessions and engaging discussions, we aim to 
            foster a deeper understanding of physics. Our main focus is 
            preparing for national-level physics competitions, where we 
            put our knowledge and skills to the test against other students 
            from across the country. We are planning on competing in the 
            wellrenowned F=ma competition, Physics Bowl and even USAPHO! 
            We're also hoping to plan fun events like field trips to 
            local science institutions, so be on the lookout
